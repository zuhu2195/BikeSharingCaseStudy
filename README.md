# Bike Sharing Case Study
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. Our Aim is to identify which variables are significant for predicting the demand for shared bikes and also how well the variables describe the bike demands.

## General Information
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
- as the number of casual users increase, more people become interested in bike sharing service and register themselves for the same.
- we can see that yearr has positive impact on cnt, which means from 2018 to 2019 more people are using the service. i.e bike sharing services are gaining popularity.
- winter has a small positive correlation, this might mean that for small errands or small distances people prefer bikes than cars since it is a hassle to heat up the engine of car.
- during misty, rainy_or_snowy weather it is definitely more feasible to take a car than a bike, since it becomes difficult to ride a bike in these conditions. however the impact of mist is quite less as compared to rainy_or_snowy conditions.
- if windspeed is high then too driving bikes becomes difficult.
- more people use bike service on a workingday than on a holiday.
- spring has a negative coefficient which is surprising. It might mean that holidays of school kids fall during spring break and hence people move to their hometowns or spend time with their family which leads to less usage of bike service.
